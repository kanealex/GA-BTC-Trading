# Genetic Algorithm for Bitcoin

Welcome to the **Genetic Algorithm for Bitcoin** repository! This project focuses on implementing a genetic algorithm to optimize Bitcoin trading strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- ccxt (3.0.89)
- indicators
- matplotlib (3.6.0)
- numpy (1.23.4)
- pandas (1.3.5)
- session_info (1.0.0)
- ta

### Execution

The project consists of the following files:

- **bot.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the genetic algorithm implementation and Bitcoin trading strategies.

- **indicators.py**: This Python script contains utility functions for calculating technical indicators used in the trading strategies.

To execute the project, open the `bot.ipynb` notebook file and execute the cells in sequential order by pressing `Shift + Enter` or selecting "Run" from the Jupyter Notebook menu.

It's important to execute the cells in order as some cells may depend on the outputs of previous cells.
